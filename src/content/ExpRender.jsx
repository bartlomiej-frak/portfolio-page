                    I have integrated art therapy methods into my workshops, allowing participants
                    to engage in a therapeutic and expressive experience. Through various art forms
                    and techniques, I create a safe and supportive environment where individuals can
                    freely express themselves, explore their emotions, and discover new insights.
